<WHAT IS BRANCH?>

- Branch is the copy of project.
- If you want to make some function on project, make branch to save our project.

(If you look at the before branch.png and after branch.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

<HOW TO USE BRANCH?>

- If you want to make branch...
    -> git branch BranchName
    Ex) git branch coupon

- If you want to switch branch...
    -> git switch BranchName
    Ex) git switch coupon

(The first branch is the main or master branch.)

(If you look at the main and coupon branch.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

- If you want to see the current branch status...
    -> git log --onelin --all --graph

(HEAD means the branch where you currently in)

(If you look at the branch status.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

<HOW TO MERGE THE BRANCHS?>

- If you want to merge the branchs...
    -> git switch BranchName1
    -> git merge BranchName2
    Ex) git swtich main
        git merge coupon

(BranchName2 is incorporated into BranchName1.)

(If you look at the branch merge.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

- If you modify the same line with the same file in both branchs, merge conflict occurs.
    -> If merge conflict occurs, you have to do git add and git commit after choosing between the two.
