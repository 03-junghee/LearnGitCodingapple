- Git difftool compares the difference between the previous code and the currunt code in Vim.
- You can control scrool bar by pressing h, j, k, l key.
- If you want to quit, pres :q or :qa.

- If you want to compare the difference between the particular code and the currunt code...
    -> git difftool CommitId
    Ex) git difftool 7ed6a66

- If you want to compare certain codes...
    -> git difftool CommitId1 CommitId2
    Ex) git difftool 7ed6a66 a91bc66

(If you look at the commit id.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

- If you write the sentence at the bottom in cmd, you can open the git difftool in VSCode instead of Vim.

    -> git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE'
